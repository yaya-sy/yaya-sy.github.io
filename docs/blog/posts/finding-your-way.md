# Finding your way

$$
\sum_{i \in \mathcal{Y}} p_{i}
$$
```

If that doesn't work either, let's check a few things:

1. **Make sure you renamed the file correctly**: It should be `docs/javascripts/katex.js` (not mathjax.js)

2. **Verify the file structure**:
```

| Algorithm | Time Complexity | Space |
|:----------|:---------------:|------:|
| DFS       | $O(V + E)$      | $O(V)$ |
| BFS       | $O(V + E)$      | $O(V)$ |
| Dijkstra  | $O(E \log V)$   | $O(V)$ |
